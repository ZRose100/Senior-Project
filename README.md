# Senior-Project
Utilizing scrubbed data from Dallas charity The Senior Source to create categorization models and analysis.

For my senior capstone project, myself and four other classmates were tasked with working with The Senior Source, a Dallas-based charity focuising on providing assistance to the elderly. For this project, we werer asked to take the contact data from a period of approximately six months and draw meaningful analysis to present back to the company. We gave the company this analysis while also expadning upon what was asked of us by implementing categorization and prioritization models that would make the organization and legibility of these incoming requests more manageable for The Senior Source. My personal focus was on the categorization model, and so that is the code that can be seen here. Not all code from this project is listed in this repository, as my teammates in this project also contributed their own code, but all the code listed here is the code I contributed to the project.

Note that the model we ended up going forward with was the NMF model, as we felt it gave the most diverse view of the issues The Senior Source's clientele were facing without getting repetitive. Since most of the methods we tried out were unsupervised, there were no meaningful comparison or accuracy metrics to create, so our choice was made subjectively but with much deliberation.
