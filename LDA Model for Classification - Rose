She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy. My mother has Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage - which is a commercial retirement plan that will cover residential treatment. \\n\\nI would like to understand how I can obtain social work support for her. \\n\\nThank you [NAME]\",\n          \"I am local and would love an opportunity to provide you with a professional cleaning quote.

She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy. My mother has Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage - which is a commercial retirement plan that will cover residential treatment. \\n\\nI would like to understand how I can obtain social work support for her. \\n\\nThank you [NAME]\",\n          \"I am local and would love an opportunity to provide you with a professional cleaning quote.

She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy. My mother has Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage - which is a commercial retirement plan that will cover residential treatment. \\n\\nI would like to understand how I can obtain social work support for her. \\n\\nThank you [NAME]\",\n          \"I am local and would love an opportunity to provide you with a professional cleaning quote.

She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy. My mother has Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage - which is a commercial retirement plan that will cover residential treatment. \\n\\nI would like to understand how I can obtain social work support for her. \\n\\nThank you [NAME]\",\n          \"I am local and would love an opportunity to provide you with a professional cleaning quote.

She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy.

She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy. My mother has Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage - which is a commercial retirement plan that will cover residential treatment. \\n\\nI would like to understand how I can obtain social work support for her. \\n\\nThank you [NAME]\",\n          \"I am local and would love an opportunity to provide you with a professional cleaning quote.

She has recently moved here from Michigan. She is suffering from paranoia and was released to me from being admitted to Harbor Oaks Hospital in Michigan in Nov 2024. Since she has been here she has completed the IOP program with Carrolton Springs and has two appointments with a therapist twice weekly. She feels  definitely needs more support as we are looking to find a residential options for her and possibly more definitive evaluative support. \\n\\nSince she has been here and with my knowledge of some of her experiences, she has had difficulty with technology, hearing loss, attentiveness, paranoia, difficulty with managing financial and residential matters, and substance issues. My mom is 74, divorced, and her background is social work/therapy. My mother has Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage - which is a commercial retirement plan that will cover residential treatment. \\n\\nI would like to understand how I can obtain social work support for her. \\n\\nThank you [NAME]\",\n          \"I am local and would love an opportunity to provide you with a professional cleaning quote.
